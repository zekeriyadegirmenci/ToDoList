# To-Do List App Using MVVM Architecture

This is a simple To-Do List app built with SwiftUI using the MVVM architecture. The app allows users to create and manage tasks. It also supports session management, so tasks are saved and persist even when the app is closed.

### Key Features:
1. **Task Management**: 
   Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
   
2. **Session Management**: 
   The tasks are saved locally, so they persist even after the app is closed and reopened.

### Screenshots:

Below are some screenshots from the app:
